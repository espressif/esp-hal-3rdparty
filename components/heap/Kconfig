    help
        Enable heap poisoning features to detect heap corruption caused by out-of-bounds access to heap memory.

        "Basic" heap corruption detection disables poisoning, but in Debug mode an assertion will trigger if an
        application overwrites the heap's internal block headers and corrupts the heap structure.

        "Light impact" detection "poisons" memory allocated from the heap with 4-byte head and tail "canaries". If an
        application overruns its bounds at all, these canaries will be compromised. This option increases memory usage,
        each allocated buffer will use an extra 9-12 bytes from the heap.

        "Comprehensive" detection incorporates the "light impact" detection features plus additional checks for
        uinitialised-access and use-after-free bugs. All freshly allocated memory is set to the pattern 0xce, and all
        freed memory is set to the pattern 0xfe. These options have a noticeable additional performance impact.

        To check the integrity of all heap memory at runtime, see the function heap_caps_check_integrity().

        Enables the heap tracing API defined in esp_heap_trace.h.

        This function causes a moderate increase in IRAM code side and a minor increase in heap function
        (malloc/free/realloc) CPU overhead, even when the tracing feature is not used. So it's best to keep it disabled
        unless tracing is being used.

config HEAP_TRACING_STACK_DEPTH

    depends on HEAP_TRACING
    help
        Number of stack frames to save when tracing heap operation callers.

        More stack frames uses more memory in the heap trace buffer (and slows down allocation), but
        can provide useful information.
