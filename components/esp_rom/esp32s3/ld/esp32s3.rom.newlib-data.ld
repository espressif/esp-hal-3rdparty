 * These are the .bss/.data symbols used by newlib functions present in ESP32S3 ROM.
 * See also esp32s3.rom.newlib-funcs.ld for the list of general newlib functions.

 * Unlike other ROM functions which declare weak symbols using PROVIDE,
 * newlib related functions are exported using assignment, which declare strong symbols.

 * Note: These ROM data are always linked instead of the ones provided by libc.a.
