# This file documents the expected order of execution of ESP_SYSTEM_INIT_FN functions.
#
# When adding new ESP_SYSTEM_INIT_FN functions or changing init priorities of existing functions,
# keep this file up to date. This is checked in CI.
# When adding new functions or changing the priorities, please read the comments and see if
# they need to be updated to be consistent with the changes you are making.
#
# Entries are ordered by the order of execution (i.e. from low priority values to high ones).
# Each line has the following format:
#   prio: function_name in path/to/source_file on affinity_expression
# Where:
#   prio: priority value (higher value means function is executed later)
#   affinity_expression: bit map of cores the function is executed on


# esp_timer has to be initialized early, since it is used by several other components
100: esp_timer_startup_init in components/esp_timer/src/esp_timer.c on BIT(0)

# esp_sleep doesn't have init dependencies
105: esp_sleep_startup_init in components/esp_hw_support/sleep_modes.c on BIT(0)

# the rest of the components which are initialized from startup.c
# [refactor-todo]: move init calls into respective components
200: init_components0 in components/esp_system/startup.c on BIT(0)
